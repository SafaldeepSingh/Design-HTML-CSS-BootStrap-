                    <p>Our expertise includes more than assisting you in a real estate transaction.
                        We have a history of expertise on both the analytical and financial sides of a real estate
                        transaction. Before any decisive steps are taken in a project, we work with you to understand
                        where the financial risks and opportunities lie. We have developed properties and various types
                        of projects. We pride ourselves on providing individual attention, a thorough market analysis,
                        and the most up-to-date invaluable insider’s perspective on the state’s various regions and
                        submarkets

                    <p>We have made it our priority to become experts at performing due diligence functions and
                        assessing the underlying value of a given real estate transaction. Planning is a single
                        decisive factor determining the success or failure of a given project or venture. While our
                        services are extremely diverse, our goals remain constant – to assess value and to determine
                        the most advantageous time to realize the value.<br/><br/>
                        Our strategic planning provides a wide range of business planning for clients, lender and
                        investors. We are experienced in designing solutions to all different types of projects,
                        including structuring entities and transactions, minimizing tax costs and customized financing.
                        Our transactional experience also includes acquisitions and development, equity investment and
                        traditional financing, construction, leasing, workouts and debt restructuring, land use and
                        zoning matters.
